# Make a class Employee with a name and salary. Make a class Manager inherit from Employee.
# Add an instance variable, named _department, that stores a string.
# Supply a method __repr__ that prints the managerâ€™s name, department, and salary.
# Make a class Executive inherit from Manager.
# Supply appropriate __repr__ methods for all classes.
# Create a test program that tests these classes and methods.
